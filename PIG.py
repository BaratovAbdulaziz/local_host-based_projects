**Welcome to The game PIG**
      [Hope you know the rules!!!]
      But whatever, here are the rules:

      - Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either:
          a) They roll a 1 (and lose all points for that turn), or
          b) They choose to "hold" (and add the turn total to their score).
      - First player to reach 100 points wins.
      - Rolling a 1 ends your turn with 0 points added.
      - You can hold at any time to save your points.
